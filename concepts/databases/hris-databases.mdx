  **Two types of HRIS databases**

  Runway supports two types of HRIS databases:
  
  - **New HRIS databases** - Function like standard dimensional databases. You can reference them directly in formulas and use the same data shaping patterns you're familiar with from other databases. When segmenting by dimensions that change over time (like Department or Job Title), there's a specific approach to follow.
  
  - **Legacy HRIS databases** - Use specialized behavior with field columns instead of drivers, and require the "Expand by Dimension" feature for segmentation.
  
  The documentation below describes legacy HRIS database behavior. For guidance on both types, see our [headcount planning guide](https://docs.runway.com/guides/modeling/headcount-planning).

## Rows represent an employee defined by their name

In typical Runway databases, [**segmentation determines the granularity of your database**](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/databases/databases-basics#adding-a-row). Each row has a **unique combination** of dimension values.

In HRIS databases, each row each row represents a single **employee, identified by their name.**

## Columns are fields, not drivers

Unlike standard databases in Runway, HRIS columns are **fields**, not drivers.

As a result, reusing HRIS data elsewhere—whether in formulas or on pages—works a bit differently.

### Using HRIS data in formulas

The HRIS database stores data such as salaries, bonuses, and benefits for each employee. To use this data in calculations—for example, to sum salaries across departments—you’ll typically want to aggregate field columns into a standard driver.

Here’s how:

1. Create a regular driver in a driver table block (on a [page](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/drivers-table-block) or in a [model](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/models/models-basics)).
2. In the formula editor, search for and reference the field column from the Employees database. You can search by the field column name, but not by the employee name or any of its attributes.

3. Add an aggregator (e.g. sum) and use filters to define which employees to include.

### Surfacing HRIS data on a page

When sharing or collaborating on HRIS data, you typically don’t need to display the entire Employees database. Instead, you have a couple of focused options:

1. Add the calculated drivers (as described in the previous section) to a [driver table block](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/drivers-table-block) or a [chart block](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/charts-block) to show totals or trends.
2. Include a [filtered view of the Employees database](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/database-block) to highlight specific roles, departments, or planned hires.

## Adding rows to HRIS databases

You can manually add rows to HRIS databases to model future employees or anticipated hires. Keep these important points in mind:

- Each row inherits the default formula set for field columns, and **these formulas cannot be overridden for individual rows.**
- When actual employee data is later imported from your HRIS system, **it won't automatically reconcile with manually added placeholder employees**. You'll need to manage this reconciliation.

## Adding columns to HRIS databases

You can add new field columns to include additional logic or metadata (e.g. currency conversions, benefits, taxes):

- Click the **\+** button \> **Fields** \> choose a field type (e.g. Number Field).
- Supported column types include:
  - Number Fields
  - Date Fields
  - Text Fields

<Warning>
  Be sure to select column types nested under the **Fields** option, not the regular driver column types.
</Warning>

## Setting formulas in HRIS databases

Each column in the HRIS database can include a formula that applies to all rows.

- Formulas can't be overridden at the row level.
- These formulas use the dynamic "This" reference pattern to refer to values in the same row. This enables logic like `Total Salary = Base Salary * 1.25` to apply uniformly across employees.
- References to segments in **other** databases are not currently supported. HRIS formulas can only reference columns within the same database.

## Start date

Every employee row includes a **Start date** field that acts as a switch for time-based calculations:

- Before the start date, any formulas for the row's fields evaluate to `NULL`.
- After the start date, formulas evaluate as normal.

This behavior works implicitly, similar to wrapping every field's formula in a condition like:

```
if(thisMonth() < this.Start Date, [column’s formula], NULL)
```

Start Date also defines which employees show up on your Plans timeline. [You can read more about how Plans work with employee start dates here.](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/plans#connecting-an-employee%E2%80%99s-start-date-to-a-plan)
