title: "Drill-ins (beta)"
description: "When working in a model, you might find yourself asking: What contributes to this line? Where does this number come from? Drill-ins (currently in beta) allow you to explore these relationships, showing exactly how your numbers connect throughout your model."

  **Interested in getting access?**

  Let your CXM know, or ping **@Nadine Mansour** in Slack.

  Since drill-ins are in beta, we’d love your **feedback**—let us know if you have ideas or run into unexpected behavior\\\\!

## How to use drill-ins

To drill into a driver in a **driver table**:

- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to toggle the drill-in state.
- Or, right-click the **driver name** and select **Drill in**.
- Or, hover over the driver name and click the **toggle caret** that appears.

Once expanded, the driver’s **inputs** (based on its formulas) will be displayed **indented inline**.

- A **gray keyline** indicates the input comes from **actuals formulas**.
- A **blue keyline** indicates the input comes from **forecast formulas**.

To collapse a drill-in:

- Click the **toggle caret** on the expanded driver.
- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` on the root expanded driver.
- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Option/Alt + Enter` on a **striped input line** to collapse its parent.

<Check>
  Drill-ins **support multiple levels** of depth—expand an input line further to see its underlying dependencies.

## Drill-ins permissions

Drill-ins **follow the same permissions** as the **driver detail pane**:

- **Admins** → Can drill in freely across the entire model.
- **Managers & Members** → Can see **direct (first-level) inputs** but cannot drill further into drivers they **don’t have access to**.
- **Guests** → Cannot use drill-ins.

For a full breakdown of roles and permissions, see this guide.

## Important notes

### Drill-ins are saved per user

- Expanding drill-ins **only affects your own view**—others won’t see the expanded state unless they do it themselves.
- This allows multiple users to explore without disrupting each other’s workflow.
- We’re considering ways to **share drill-in states**, so let us know if this would be useful.

### Want others to see a breakdown?

If you want other users to view the same expansion:

1. **Guide them** to use the drill-in feature themselves
2. **Explicitly add** selected drill-in drivers to the block:
   - Select the expanded drill-in drivers
   - Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + B` or **right-click** → **Add to block**

This will make those driver lines **visible to everyone.**

### Drill-in lines have a striped background

**Stripes indicate drill-in lines** are **dynamically generated** and won’t appear for other users unless expanded.

<Warning>
  **Drag-and-drop** to reorder is **not supported** for drill-in lines.

  **Undo/redo** is not supported for drill-in lines.
