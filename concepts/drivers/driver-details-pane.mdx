This pane is a really handy surface to dive deep into a driver and how it fits into your model. It is especially useful for:

- Viewing and editing all driver settings in one place.
- Exploring the inputs that contribute to a driver’s values to troubleshoot discrepancies or errors.

## **What's inside the driver details pane?**

 1. **Name** – The driver’s name.
 2. **Breadcrumbs** – Shows where the driver is located in your model.
 3. **Description** – Context or notes about the driver.
 4. **Models** – Lists all pages where the driver is used.
 5. **Dimensions** – Explains how the driver is segmented. [Link: Dimensions article]
 6. [**Format**](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/drivers/driver-formatting) – Adjusts display settings for numeric drivers.
 7. **Goal** – Assign a target value to the driver.
    - The target appears as a \*\*goal line \*\*when plotted on a chart.
    - Used in scenario comparisons or BvA (Budget vs. Actuals) to determine whether values are displayed as red or green.
    - By default, higher values are considered _better_.
 8. **Rollup by** – Specifies how the driver's values aggregate when viewing time periods longer than one month, such as quarterly, year-to-date, or annual (e.g. sum, first, last).
 9. **Goal** – Defines how the driver aggregates (e.g., sum, last)over longer periods (Quarterly, Annual). For example:
    - Revenue → Roll up by **SUM** (to see total revenue in a year).
    - \*\*Cash balance \*\*→ Roll up by **LAST** (to see the ending balance for a year).
10. [**Actuals formula**](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/drivers/drivers-basics#driver-formulas) – Expanded space for editing the driver’s actuals formula.
11. [**Forecast formula**](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/drivers/drivers-basics#driver-formulas) – Expanded space for editing the driver’s forecast formula.
12. [**Driver type**](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/drivers/drivers-basics#driver-types) – Clearly indicates whether the driver stores **Numbers or Dates**.
13. **Driver timeseries table** – A dedicated table displaying the driver’s values over time. The columns are controlled by settings under **Customize** [19].
14. **Direct inputs tab** – Shows all direct inputs contributing to this driver (i.e., referenced in its formula). You can open the details pane for these inputs directly from this tab.
15. **Indirect inputs tab** – Displays a full dependency tree, showing all direct and indirect inputs feeding into the driver. This can get long in complex models and may be truncated.
16. **Used by** – Lists all other drivers that reference this driver in their formulas.
17. [**Plans**](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/plans) – Displays any Plans applied to this driver.
18. **Secondary / Inputs table** – Displays results from the Direct Inputs, Indirect Inputs, Used By, or Plans tabs.
19. **Delete** – Click the **trash can** icon to delete the driver.
20. **Customize menu** – Adjusts which columns and time ranges are displayed in the Driver timeseries table [12] and the Secondary/Inputs Table [17].
