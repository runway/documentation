title: "Formatting drivers"
description: "Drivers in Runway can be formatted to display values exactly as you expect. This guide provides an overview of the different types of formatting and available options."

There are **three types of formatting** that can be applied to drivers:

1. **Global formatting** → Applies to **all drivers** across Runway.
2. **Data formatting** → Controls how **a specific driver's values** are displayed (e.g., number format, date format, precision, currency).
3. **Display formatting** → Controls how **a specific driver appears** in **driver table blocks** (e.g., color, text style, name format).

## **Global formatting**

Global formatting settings apply to **all drivers** in Runway across every page. These settings can be found in **Settings → General** and control the following defaults:

- **Currency format** → Set to **USD** by default, but can be changed.
- **Negative number display** → Defaults to using a **negative sign** (e.g., `1000`), but can be switched to **parentheses** (e.g., `(1000)`).
- **Number precision** → Defaults to using **up to two decimal places** for values that include decimals.

These settings ensure consistency across all drivers while allowing customization as needed.

## **Data formatting**

Data formatting determines how a **specific driver's values** (numbers or dates) appear across all tables, including both **driver tables** and **database tables**.

To adjust data formatting, **right-click** on a numeric driver in a table and use the options:

- **Format** — Drivers can be formatted as:
  - **Automatic** → Attempts to infer the best display format based on the driver’s formula. (e.g., If an input is a percentage, the result will also be formatted as a percentage.)
  - **Currency** → Displays values in the selected currency.
  - **Number** → Shows numbers with decimal precision.
  - **Integer** → Displays whole numbers only (no decimals).
  - **Percentage** → Formats the value as a percentage.
- **Currency** — Available when the **Currency** format is selected. Options include:
  - **US Dollars (USD)**
  - **Australian Dollars (AUD)**
  - **Canadian Dollars (CAD)**
  - **Euros (EUR)**
  - **British Pounds (GBP)**
  - **Indian Rupees (INR)**
  - **Japanese Yen (JPY)**
  - **New Zealand Dollars (NZD)**
- **Precision** → can set numeric drivers to display between **0 and 5 decimal places** for better control over rounding and accuracy.

## **Display formatting**

The display formatting of a driver applies **globally** across all **driver table blocks**, ensuring consistency wherever the driver appears. However, these settings **do not affect databases**.

The following options control how drivers are visually presented:

- **Background color** — Changes the driver row’s background color. Options include:
  - Default (white)
  - Grey
  - Green
  - Yellow
  - Red
- **Text style** — Adjusts how the driver name and values are displayed:
  - Bold
  - Strikethrough
  - Underline
  - Multiple styles can be applied at once.
- **Indent / Outdent** — Adjusts the indentation of the driver for better organization and readability.
- **Hide driver name, Hide segment, and Segment style** — These options apply to **drivers with dimensions**. You can read more about dimensions **[here] (Coming Soon)**.
- **Cell-specific styling** — You can also apply **background and text formatting** to **specific month values** within a table. To do this, **right-click a month’s value** and apply the desired style.
