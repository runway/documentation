title: "Duplicating, removing & deleting"
description: "Whether you're experimenting with variations, cleaning up a table, or permanently removing data, this article covers everything you need to know about duplicating, removing, and deleting drivers in Runway—and when to use each option."

## Duplicating drivers

Duplicating a driver is a fast way to create a new, **independent** driver with the same formulas, segments, and values as the original.

- Use the shortcut: `cmd`  or `ctrl` \+ `D`
- The new driver will have “Copy” appended to the name.
- It’s completely separate from the original—**no link or dependency** remains.
- Any **segments** from the original driver are also copied over to the new one.

<Warning>
  If you find yourself duplicating drivers often and swapping out logic, this might be a sign your use case is a good fit for **dimensional modeling in databases**, as this is much more scalable.
</Warning>

If you'd like to make a new driver, connected to an existing set of segments in your model, you can:

- Make a new driver with the same name.
- Right click the new driver, and link them under _Dimensions \> "Make Subdriver of"_, and then select the set of existing drivers

## Removing vs. deleting drivers

You have two options when you no longer need a driver in the table you’re working in:

- **Remove from block** _(shortcut: ⌫)_ — Removes the driver only from the current view. The driver will still exist in other tables where it’s used, and any formula references will remain intact. This is not a destructive action and will not impact your model.
- **Delete** _(shortcut: ⇧_ \+ _⌫)_ — Removes the driver from the entire model and all tables it appears in. Any formulas referencing this driver will break. This is a destructive action and applies to the current scenario you’re working in.

Pressing **Backspace** removes the driver only from the current table, preserving it in the rest of your model.

Since **Remove from block** is non-destructive and the default action, it's possible to remove a driver from every table it was shown in—without actually deleting it. These drivers will appear in the **Unlisted Drivers** page.
