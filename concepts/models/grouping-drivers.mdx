## Why use drivers groups?

Grouping drivers helps you keep models organized by creating collapsible sections.

1. Press `Shift` and click a group’s caret to **collapse all** groups.
2. Press `Option` and click a group’s caret to **expand all** groups.

In addition to improving organization and readability, groups also make it easier to find and reuse drivers. When adding drivers to a block, you can **search by group name** and include all or a subset of drivers from that group. ![Model Groups In Search Pn](/images/models/model-groups-in-search.png)

You can also **reference an entire driver group in formulas**, instead of selecting each driver individually.

## How to group drivers?

There are a couple of ways to create groups in a model:

1. **Select and group:**
   Select the drivers you'd like to group, then right-click and choose **Group** — or press `Cmd` / `Ctrl` \+ `G`. A new group will be created with the selected drivers. Give the group a descriptive name.

2. **Create group first:**\
   Scroll to the bottom of the model and click **\+ Create group**. Give the group a name, then drag the relevant drivers into the group one by one or in bulk.\

Once your groups are set up, you can **drag and drop** groups to reorder.
