There are a couple of ways to create groups in a model:

1. **Select and group:**
   Select the drivers you'd like to group, then right-click and choose **Group** â€” or press `Cmd` / `Ctrl` \+ `G`. A new group will be created with the selected drivers. Give the group a descriptive name.

2. **Create group first:**
   Scroll to the bottom of the model and click **\+ Create group**. Give the group a name, then drag the relevant drivers into the group one by one or in bulk.

Once your groups are set up, you can organize them easily:

- **Drag and drop** groups to reorder.
- Press `Shift` while clicking the caret next to a group to **collapse all** groups.
- Press `Option` while clicking the caret to **expand all** groups.

In addition to improving organization and readability, groups also make it easier to find and reuse drivers. When adding drivers to a block, you can search by group name and include all or a subset of drivers from that group.
