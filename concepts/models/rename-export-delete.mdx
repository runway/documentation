## Renaming a mode

There are a couple of ways to rename a database:

**From the sidebar** – Click the icon next to the model name, then select **Rename.** You can modify the name and click the icon to change it.

**From the model page** – Navigate to the database, then click on its name at the top to edit it. You can also click the icon to change it.

## Exporting a model

To export a model, click the icon next to its name in the sidebar, then select **Export to CSV.**

Alternatively, navigate to the model, click the More icon in the top-right, and select Export to CSV.

## Deleting a model

To delete a model, click the icon next to its name in the sidebar or the **More** icon in the top-right corner of the database, then select **Delete model.**

Deleting a model from the sidebar does **not **delete the drivers within it. Any drivers that were only present in that model will remain in your workspace and can be found in the **Unlisted Drivers **page. If those drivers are referenced in other formulas, they’ll continue to work as expected—**formulas won’t break.**
