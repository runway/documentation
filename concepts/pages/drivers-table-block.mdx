title: "Drivers table block"
description: "Similar to chart blocks, driver table blocks let you bring in drivers from across Runway onto a single page—but instead of visualizing them as charts, they are displayed in a table format."
---

## Creating a new drivers table block

1. To add a new block to a page, type **/** to access block options.
2. Select **Driver table.**
3. Choose the **drivers** you’d like to visualize on the chart. You can **add or remove drivers** later, not just when first creating the block.

## Customizing table columns

When you first add a **driver table block** to a page, it will display the **driver name** and **data** by default. You can further customize which columns appear in the table:

1. Click **Customize** in the top-right corner of the block.
2. Select **Properties.**
3. Choose which columns to show or hide:
   - **Data**
   - **Actual Formula**
   - **Forecast Formula**
   - **Used By**
   - **Graph**
   - **Rollup**

## Managing drivers in the table

Once a table is added to a page, you can adjust which **drivers** appear in it:

1. Click **\+ Add driver** to include additional drivers. From this menu, you can either **select an existing driver** from your model or **create a new one** directly.
2. If you **right-click** on a driver name or click the **6-dot menu** to the left of any driver name, you can select **\+ Insert new driver above** or **\+ Insert new driver below **

3. **Remove a driver** from the block in two ways:
   - **Press Backspace** while the driver is selected.
   - **Right-click the driver name**, then select **Remove from block**.

  Removing a driver from the block **does not delete it from Runway**—it only removes it from this specific table. See [this article](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/drivers/duplicate-remove-delete) for details on removing v.s. deleting.

## Formatting drivers

When you add drivers to a table on a page, they **retain their existing formatting**. You can adjust their formatting—such as **color, text style, indentation, or precision**—but keep in mind that any changes will **apply globally** wherever the driver appears.

For more details on formatting, [see this article](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/drivers/driver-formatting).

## Time period rollups (quarter, year, etc)

### Selecting the time period

By default, data in a driver table block is displayed monthly, with each **month as a separate column**. But what if you want to see your drivers in a different time granularity—like by quarter or year?

1. Click **Customize** in the top right, then select **Rollups**.
2. Choose a rollup option. You can pick from:
   - **Monthly**, **Quarterly**, or **Annual**
   - **Monthly & Quarterly**, M**onthly & Annually**, or **Monthly, Quarterly & Annually**
   - For additional customization options, click **Custom rollup**, which provides additional options such as:
     - **Quarter to date**, **Half-year to date**, or **Year to date** (includes the current calendar month)
     - **Quarter to last close**, **Half-year to last close**, or **Year to last close**
     - **Trailing 3, 6, or 12 months** (relative to the current calendar month)

### Selecting the aggregation

For each driver, you can define **how its values are aggregated** when using a coarser time period:

**Right-click** the driver name → Select **Roll up by** → Choose from: **Sum** (default), **Average**, **First**, or **Last.**

![images/pages/driver-table/time-period-aggregation.png](/images/pages/driver-table/time-period-aggregation.png)

You can also show the **Rollup** property as a column:

1. Click **Customize → Properties**, then enable **Rollup.**
2. In the table, click the **Rollup cell** for a driver to adjust its aggregation method directly from there.

## Comparing drivers across scenarios

In a **driver table block**, you can compare driver values across multiple scenarios:

1. Click **Customize** in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Compare**.
3. Choose the scenarios you want to compare.

For more details, [see the scenarios article](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/scenarios#comparing-scenarios).

## Comparing drivers across time periods

In driver tables, you can compare values over time—such as **Month-over-Month (MoM)**, **Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ)**, or **Year-over-Year (YoY)**—to spot trends or changes.

1. Click **Customize** in the top right, then go to **Compare → Time period**.
2. Choose a comparison window:
   - **Previous period** – compares each period to the one before it.
   - **3 months ago** – compares each period to its value 3 months prior.
   - **6 months ago** – compares each period to 6 months prior.
   - **12 months ago** – compares each period to the same month last year.
3. Pick which metrics to display:
   - **Value**
   - **Variance**
   - **Variance %**
4. Each comparison will appear as a **new row** in your driver table, just below the original driver.
