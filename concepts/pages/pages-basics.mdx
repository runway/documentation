## Creating a page

To create a new page, follow the following steps:

1. Click the **\+** next to any section, model, database, or another page. This would allow you to create a page nested within where you clicked on the \+ button.
2. Type a name for your page and, optionally, change the icon.

## Adding a block to a page

Now that you have a blank page, you can start building content by adding **blocks**.

Type **/** to access block options:

- **Driver charts** – Visualize relevant drivers from anywhere in Runway as charts. Choose from various chart types, including **line, column, stacked, combo, waterfall, and value charts**. More on Driver chart block here.
- **Driver table** – Display a subset of drivers in a tabular format. More on Driver table block here.
- **Database table** – Bring any existing database into a page. You can **apply filters** to show only the relevant data. More on Database table block here.
- **Plan timeline** – Create a timeline of your Plans and apply filters to limit which ones appear on your page. More on Plans block here.
- **Text** – Add **text** anywhere on the page. You can also reference driver values by typing **@**, followed by the driver name, and selecting **Value on date.** Runway keeps these values updated automatically. More on Text block here.
- **Image** – Upload an image directly or embed one from a URL. More on Image block here.
- **Video** – Upload a video file or embed videos from **Loom, YouTube,** or other links. More on Video block here.

You can **switch between a Driver chart block and a Driver table block** at any time.

To do this, click the **six-dot button** on the left of the block, then select **Turn into table** or **Turn into chart.**

## Arranging blocks

Pages are designed to be **flexible**, allowing you to structure content in a way that best tells your story and organizes information effectively.

Drag a block using the **six-dot button** on the left to move it **before, after, or next to** another block.

When placing blocks side by side, you can **resize** them by **dragging the handle** between them.

If you need to create a new block similar to an existing one, you can duplicate it instead of starting from scratch. Click the **six-dot button** on the left of the block, then select **Duplicate block**.

You can quickly **move a block to a different page** by dragging it and dropping it onto the target page in the sidebar.

## Pages FAQ

<Accordion title="Can I export a page?" defaultOpen="false">
  You can export specific blocks from a page:

  - **Driver table, Driver chart, and Database blocks** – Click the **six-dot menu** on the left of the block and select **Export to CSV.**
  - **Driver chart block** – Right-click on the chart, click **Download,** and save it as a **PNG.**

  While Runway does not currently support exporting a full page as a **PDF**, some customers use **browser extensions** like [GoFullPage](https://gofullpage.com/) to capture and save entire pages.
