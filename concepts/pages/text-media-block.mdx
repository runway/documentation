## Text block

Text blocks are **simple and intuitive**—just start typing in any blank space. That’s it\\!

To insert a new text block **between existing blocks**, click the `+` button on the left of the top block where you want to add text, then select **Text**.

You can format your text in various ways:

- **Headings** → Choose from `H1`, `H2`, or `H3`:
  - Use the toolbar or **markdown shortcuts** (`#` for H1, `##` for H2, `###` for H3).
- **Text styles** → Apply **bold**, _italic_, underline, or ~~strikethrough~~.
- **Lists** → Create **bullet points** or **numbered lists**.
- **Hyperlinks** → Add links to external content for additional context.

## Image block

To add visuals from outside Runway, use an image block. Simply type `/` to open the block menu and select **Image**.

You can then:

- **Upload an image** from your computer.
- **Embed an image URL** to display an external image.

Once the image is uploaded, you can **resize** it and adjust its **alignment** to **left, center, or right** for better positioning on the page.

## Video block

Video blocks work similarly to image blocks. Select **Video** from the block creation menu, then:

- **Upload a video file** from your computer.
- **Embed a link** from **Loom, YouTube, or Vimeo.**
