In Runway, they connect strategic initiatives directly to your model, making it easy to understand how your sales, marketing, and operational decisions impact key metrics. Plans help you see how each change shifts your numbers."

## **Modifying forecasts and tag them with plans**

You can tag any change you make to timeseries values—whether in a **driver table**, **database**, or the **driver detail view**—with a plan. Let’s walk through how this works using a driver table as an example.

[Drivers in Runway store timeseries data](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/drivers/drivers-basics#what-is-a-driver%3F). Their **historical values** are pulled from your integrations and calculated using **actuals formulas**. Their **forecasted values**—those after your Last Close date—are generated by your **forecast formulas**.

While forecast values typically flow from your formulas, you can override specific months and tag those changes with plans. For example, if your forecast formula for CXM team capacity is set to repeat the previous month’s value, but you expect an increase in June due to an upcoming product launch, you can leave the formula as-is and simply override the June value—tagging that adjustment with a plan tied to the product change.

Because multiple initiatives can impact the same metric—say, a fundraise and a new marketing push both influencing cash flow—Runway allows you to tag the same cell in the timeseries with **multiple plans.**

1. Here’s how to modify a cell and connect adjustments to specific plans:
2. Select a forecast value (after your Last Close date).
3. Press `Enter` to edit the cell, or double-click it.
4. Enter your adjustment:
   - Use **Backspace** to clear the forecasted value and type a new one.

     ![Set Plan Gi](/images/plans/set-plan.gif)
   - Use `+` or `-` to add or subtract from the forecasted value. You can enter multiple adjustments—each can be tagged to a different plan.

     ![Stacked Plans Gi](/images/plans/stacked-plans.gif)
5. Press `Shift` \+ `Enter` or click **Tag plan** to tag each adjustment to a plan.
6. To remove the impact of any plans affecting a cell, press **Backspace** while the cell is selected.

<Info>
  If you modify a cell without tagging it, Runway will automatically assign the change to the **Default Plan**. To update the plan later, you can either:

  - Select the cell and press `Shift + Enter`, or
  - Double-click the cell and click **Tag plan** to tag each adjustment to a specific plan.
</Info>

<Check>
  To tag multiple cells with the same plan at once, select them all, then click **Tag plan** (or press Shift \+ Enter).
</Check>

Cells with one or more plan adjustments will show an underline. Hover over the cell to see which plans are applied.

## **Connecting an employee’s start date to a plan**

If you're working in an **Employees database** generated from one of our supported [HRIS integrations](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/hris), it includes a **Start Date** column by default.

- If any synced employees have a **Start Date in the future**, Runway will automatically tag them as part of your **Default Plans**.
- When you manually add new rows for future hires, assigning a **Start Date** in the future will also include them in your **Default Plans**.

![Default Plans Start Date Pn](/images/plans/default-plans-start-date.png)

Keep reading to learn how to better organize your plans—and move them out of the **Default Plans** bucket into more meaningful plan groups.

<Info>
  Deleting a plan that originates from a new database row will clear the **Start Date** for that object, but the row itself won’t be deleted or lost.

## **Organizing your plans**

Your list of plans can grow quickly. To keep things organized, you can group related plans together.

Let’s say you want to create a group for all your engineering headcount plans:

1. Navigate to the **Plans** page from the sidebar. You'll see a list of all your existing plans.
2. Hold `Cmd` or `Ctrl` and select the plans you want to group.
3. Right-click the selection and choose **Group**. Enter a name and press Enter. Alternatively, you can press `Cmd` or `Ctrl`  \+  `G` to group them instantly.

## Surfacing plans in pages

[Pages](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/pages-basics) let you bring different parts of your model together on a single canvas—making collaboration and reporting easier.

To add a plans block to a page:

1. Type **/** and select **Plan Timeline**. This will surface all plans in the current [scenario](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/scenarios) as a new block.
2. Apply filters to show only the plans relevant to the page. You can filter by plan name, model, and more.
3. Drag and drop plans to reorder them.

To get the most value from a plans timeline block, we recommend pairing it with a [chart block](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/charts-block) that visualizes key upstream metrics impacted by those plans.

Once you’ve added both blocks, you can begin experimenting:

- Adjust plan values for a single month—leaving the rest unchanged.
- Push a plan forward or backward in time to change when it takes effect.
- Stretch a plan across multiple months:
  - If the plan’s change is defined by the `=` operator, the value is repeated across all months.
  - If the plan uses a `+` or `-` operator, the total impact is **distributed**. For example, if a `+10` change originally applied to one month is stretched across two, each month will apply a `+5`.

## **Accessing a plan’s details**

1. Click the upward arrow next to a plan’s name on the timeline to open the plan’s detail view.
2. You’ll see a timeline of all drivers and database rows impacted by that plan.
3. Any drivers you’ve marked as KPIs will also appear, so you can adjust the plan directly in this view and immediately see how it affects those key metrics.

## **Deleting a plan**

- To delete a plan permanently, right-click its name and select **Delete**.
- Alternatively, if you’re in the details view, you can click on the **Delete** icon at the top right.

![Delete Plan Timeline Pn](/images/plans/delete-plan-timeline.png)

You can also delete the impact of the plan on a single driver. To do this, right-click the driver's name in the timeline and select Delete.

## **Plans FAQ**

<Accordion title="Could moving my Last Close date forward delete my plans?">
  No.

  Let’s say you have a plan that impacts your `Office Costs` driver for Jan, Feb, and March. If you move your `Last Close` date to Apr, plans that were previously set to Jan through April will not get deleted. They will remain in Runway, accessible via the Plans section or any Plan timeline added to a page.

  However, depending on your setup, your plans may or may not influence cells currently preceding your `Last Close`.

  Here’s how it works in Runway:

  - If you’d manually added hardcoded values for months falling before `Last Close`, Runway will display those numbers. If not present:
  - Runway will rely on the Actuals Formula for drivers, or the integration data for databases connected to an integration. If not present:
  - Runway will use any hardcoded plans you'd created for those months _before_ moving your `Last Close` date forward. If not present:
  - Runway will depend on the Forecast Formula.
