## Default sidebar structure

When you first start using Runway, the sidebar includes:

* **Three customizable sections**: **Models, Databases, Pages.** You can rename, reorder, or delete these sections.

* **Static sections** that cannot be edited: **Integrations, Plans, Templates, and Whatâ€™s New.**

We recommend structuring the sidebar with **sections** to group related models, databases, and pages. For example, you might have:

* A section for **department pages**

* Another for **P\&L reports** at different levels of granularity

* A section for **executive reporting**

To create a new section, click the **+** button in the **top-right** of the sidebar, then give it a **name** and **icon**. It will appear as the first section.

You can **move** a section by dragging it to the right spot. To **rename or delete** a section, click the **`...`** button next to its name.

To add content within a section, click the **+** button next to the section name. Any **model, database, or page** created this way will be added to that section.

You can also **move existing items** into a section by dragging them. Additionally, you can **nest** models, databases, or pages under each other by dragging them beneath one another.

### Icons for easier scanning

Every **section, model, database, or page** in Runway can have an **emoji or icon** to make it easier to recognize at a glance.

* Runway offers **1,000+ icons** in nine colors.

* Emojis also support **skin tone variations**.

To change an icon for an existing section, models, databases, or pages, click the **`...`** button next to its name and select **"Rename"** From there, you can edit the name and choose a new icon.

When selecting an icon, you can switch between **icons and emojis** at the top of the selection panel and use **search** to find the right one. Icons also allow you to **customize colors**.
