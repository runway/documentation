## Default sidebar structure

When you first start using Runway, the sidebar includes:

- **Three customizable sections**: **Models, Databases, Pages.** You can rename, reorder, or delete these sections.
- **Static sections** that cannot be edited: **Integrations, Plans, Templates, and Whatâ€™s New.**

## Sections for better organization

We recommend structuring the sidebar with **sections** to group related models, databases, and pages. For example, you might have:

- A section for **department pages**
- Another for **P&L reports** at different levels of granularity
- A section for **executive reporting**

To create a new section, click the **\+** button in the **top-right** of the sidebar, then give it a **name** and **icon**. It will appear as the first section.

You can **move** a section by dragging it to the right spot. To **rename or delete** a section, click the  button next to its name.

To add content within a section, click the **\+** button next to the section name. Any **model, database, or page** created this way will be added to that section.

You can also **move existing items** into a section by dragging them. Additionally, you can **nest** models, databases, or pages under each other by dragging them beneath one another.

You can expand and collapse all elements in the sidebar in bulk with the shortcut `Cmd / Shift + Click` on any section in the sidebar, similar to excel's hide / show group behavior. 

## Icons for easier scanning

Every **section, model, database, or page** in Runway can have an **emoji or icon** to make it easier to recognize at a glance.

- Runway offers **1,000\+ icons** in nine colors.
- Emojis also support **skin tone variations**.

To change an icon for an existing section, models, databases, or pages, click the  button next to its name and select **"Rename"** From there, you can edit the name and choose a new icon.

When selecting an icon, you can switch between **icons and emojis** at the top of the selection panel and use **search** to find the right one. Icons also allow you to **customize colors**.
