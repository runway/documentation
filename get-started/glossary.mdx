### **Dimension**

A data type in Runway—like numbers or dates—used to categorize data. Common examples:

- **GL dimensions**: `Class`, `Account`, `Account Type`, `Vendor`
- **HRIS dimensions**: `Role`, `Department`, `Location`
- **CRM dimensions**: `Region`, `Pipeline Stage`

**Dimension values** are the options within a dimension (e.g. `Marketing`, `Engineering`, `Sales` for the `Class` dimension).

### Driver

A time series that tracks numerical or date-based values over time. Drivers come in these types:

- **Unsegmented driver** – Typically created in a [driver table on a page](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/drivers-table-block) or [model](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/models/models-basics) (e.g. `Burn`, `Runway`).
- **Segmented driver** – Broken down by one or more dimensions. Most often created in a database (e.g. `Amount [Account][Class]`).
  - **Segment of a driver** – A single portion of a segmented driver (e.g. `Amount [2300 — Payroll Liabilities][Engineering]`).

### Databases

Where all your structured data lives—both integration-synced and manually created.

- **Integration-created** – Pulled from [systems](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/intro-to-integrations) like your GL, HRIS, or CRM.
- **User-created** – Built from scratch for modeling assumptions, rollups, or [lookups](https://docs.runway.com/guides/modeling/lookups).

### Models

Tables of related drivers for lightweight modeling and grouping.

### Pages

A flexible canvas for combining drivers, charts, and data views to tell a story, report, or collaborate.

**Block** – Each content element on a page is a block (e.g. [driver table](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/drivers-table-block), [chart](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/charts-block), [database](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/database-block), [plan timeline](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/plans#surfacing-plans-in-pages), [text, image, video](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/pages/text-media-block)).

### Section

Used to organize your pages, models, and databases in the sidebar.

### Scenario

A version of your model. Used for simulating various scenarios, testing new ideas, and running [BvA](https://docs.runway.com/guides/modeling/bva). Scenarios can stay in sync with your Main scenario or diverge completely.

### Plans

Used to tag forecast overrides with real-world business context (e.g. hiring plans, initiatives, contracts). Helps bridge roadmap and financial data.

### Role

Determines what a user can do across your Runway workspace: Admin, Manager, Member, Guest.

[Learn more about roles →](https://docs.runway.com/guides/sharing/user-roles)

### Access level

In addition to having a role, each user can have different access levels for individual pages, models, or databases in Runway—Full access, Edit access, View access, or No access.
