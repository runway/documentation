### Core concepts

Let’s start with the basics. The **Concepts** section of the documentation helps you understand each core building block in Runway. These articles don’t walk through full workflows—instead, they focus on how each concept works on its own, so you can apply it confidently across different use cases.

### Data integrations

At the heart of everything you do in Runway is your data—pulled in from the various systems your business runs on. In the **Integrations** section, you’ll find guides for setting up the most common data sources, along with tips for [writing SQL](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/writing-sql) in Runway when needed.
