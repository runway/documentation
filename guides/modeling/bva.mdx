In Runway, you can lock different versions of your budget as reference points, and compare them to actuals as new data comes in.

This guide walks you through:

- Preparing your budget (by locking [scenarios](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/scenarios)).
- Setting up actuals using your `Last Close` date.
- Creating a BvA comparison using tables and charts.

## Step 1: Lock your budget

Your budget lives in scenarios—separate versions of your model representing different forecasts (downside, base, upside).

Before tracking BvA, you need to lock your budget scenarios so they don’t change. To do this:

1. Disable auto-updates from main to freeze the scenario:
   - In the scenarios list, click the Settings icon next to your scenario’s name.
   - Disable `Pull updates from Main`.
   - This prevents changes from main scenario and integration syncs from affecting your budget.
2. Prevent user edits for added security (optional):
   - Set `Editing` to `Disabled` in Scenario Settings.
   - This blocks accidental changes from your team.
   - If changes are needed later, you can temporarily enable `Editing`, make adjustments, then disable editing again.

## Step 2: Set up your actuals

Your planned budget now lives in a locked scenario, while actuals come from live data in your main scenario.

To ensure that actuals reflect finalized numbers:

1. Open main scenario.
2. Set `Last close` date to the end of the time period you’re analyzing.
   - For example: To compare budget vs. actuals for January–March, set `Last close` to March.
   - This tells Runway to pull actual values for closed months, while calculating future values using forecast [formulas](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/drivers/drivers-basics#driver-formulas).

## Step 3: Compare Budget vs. Actuals

You can analyze variances between budget and actuals using tables or charts.

### Option 1: Create a BvA table

1. Open a model or create a `Driver table` in any page.
2. Add the drivers you want to include in your BvA.
3. Click `Customize` (top right) → Select `Compare` → Choose budget scenarios.
4. The default view shows time-series values for each scenario. You can add `Variance` and `Variance %` to track the difference between budget and actuals.
5. You can also adjust the table layout to show scenarios as rows or columns.

**Customizing variance colors**

- By default, if actuals exceed budget, `Variance` and `Variance %` appear green. If actuals fall short, they’ll appear red.
- To reverse this—like when lower numbers are preferred for cost metrics—just set a goal for the driver to be below zero.

### Option 2: Create a BvA chart

1. Create a `Driver chart` in any **page**.
2. Add the relevant drivers.
3. Click the `Compare` icon (top right) → Select budget scenarios to compare.
4. Choose a line or column chart to visualize trends.
