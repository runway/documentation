## Step 1: Map CRM deal owners to AEs

To align commissions to individual AEs, you’ll need to connect CRM data to HRIS data.

1. Create a new database called **Account Owner Mapping**. Select your **Sales Team** database as the source and segment by **Name**.

![Commissions Data Config Pn](/images/commissions/Commissions-data-config.png)

This will create a line for each **Name** value in the **Sales Team** database.

2. Add a new dimension column and search for **Deal Owner**. Naming may vary depending on your HRIS integration. You can always check your **Deals** database for the exact dimension name.

3. For each relevant row, select the matching **Deal Owner**. Skip rows for manually added new hires—they won’t exist in your CRM data.

4. In your **Deals** database, add a **Lookup** for the \*\*Name \*\*column.

This auto-matches the records for each line. You can think about this as a human-readable VLOOKUP() from Excel. For tidiness, you can hide one of the columns by right-clicking the column header and selecting **Hide in block.**

  Note: As new employees are hired, you’ll want to revisit the **Account Owner Mapping** to connect their HRIS record to their CRM record.

## Step 2: Add commission rate logic

Create a new number driver column in the **Deals** database called **Commission Rate**.

### **Option 1: Flat Rate Commission**

To set a flat commission rate %, you can select `Add default formula` from the column header sub-menu and hardcode a percentage.

### **Option 2: Variable Commission Rates**

This example demonstrates how you can set assumptions based on dimension values. In this example, `New Business `deals earn an 8% commission, whereas `Renewals `earn a 3% commission.

- The formula references the dimension column `DEAL_TYPE` which only contains the two items: `New Business` or `Existing Business` .
- The logic of the formula reads: \_if DEAL_TYPE = New Business apply an 8% Commission Rate, otherwise apply 3% Commission Rate. \_

<Tip>
  Since commissions data is part of compensation, many model owners chose to anonymize commission rates and payouts. To do so, right-click on the driver column header and toggle \*\*Anonymize data. \*\*You can read more about Anonymizing data [here](https://docs.runway.com/guides/sharing/data-anonymization#data-anonymization)
</Tip>

### **Step 3: Add payout timing logic**

In many organizations, commission payouts are deferred until a contract has been active for a set period.

Create a new number driver in your **Deals** database called **Payout Date**. Use `dateAdd()` to add your delay to the deal’s close date. In this example, we assume a 90-day delay.

![Delaypayment Pn](/images/commissions/Delaypayment.png)

Check the values by clicking the Commissions Paid driver column header and selecting `Show as time series`. This view allows you to check whether the amounts paid land in the correct months.

## Step 5: Aggregate commissions by AE

The last step is to aggregate commissions paid by AE. 

In your **Sales Team** database, add a number driver for **Commissions. **Set the formula to sum the **Commissions Paid** driver in your **Deals** database where `Name` is `This Name.`

![Formulathissegmentcommissions Pn](/images/commissions/formulathissegmentcommissions.png)

By showing the driver column COmmissions as a time series, we can verify the commissions roll up appropriately.
