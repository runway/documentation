title: "FX rate "
description: "When working with multiple entities or subsidiaries across different regions, you often need to consolidate financial data into a single reporting currency. Runway makes this possible by allowing you to convert values denominated in different currencies into one unified currency."
---

This guide walks you through how to **import exchange rates** and **apply FX conversion** to your financial data in Runway.

## Step 1: Create a Google Sheet for exchange rates

Start by setting up a Google Sheet that will store your exchange rates.

1. Open Google Sheets by typing `sheet.new` in your browser’s address bar, or go to Google Drive and click **\+ New \> Google Sheets \> Blank spreadsheet**.
2. Rename the sheet to something recognizable (e.g., **FX for Runway**).
3. In cell **A1**, use the `IMPORTRANGE` function to pull in exchange rates from Runway’s [live FX sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAsVhuVDFbXsztrOShUc8bNEFTEa8h7LIInYUXc1opQ/edit?usp=sharing), powered by [XE.com](http://xe.com/)—the same rates used by QuickBooks and Xero:

   ```
   =IMPORTRANGE("your-source-sheet-link","ExchangeRates!A:AI")
   ```


1. Replace `"your-source-sheet-link"` with the actual link to the FX sheet: [Runway Exchange Rates Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gAsVhuVDFbXsztrOShUc8bNEFTEa8h7LIInYUXc1opQ/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Make sure the range (`A:AI`) covers all the exchange rate columns. Periodically check the sheet for new currencies and update the range as needed (e.g., A:AI → A:AK).
3. Once the data is imported, create a **named range**:
   - Highlight all the columns (not just the cells with values).
   - Go to **Data \> Named ranges**.
   - Give it a name (e.g., `runway_xe_fx`) and click **Done**.

## Step 2: Connect the FX sheet to Runway

Connect the FX Sheet to Runway using the **Google Sheets long data integration**. [Follow steps 1–11 from this guide to complete the setup.](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/data-storage/google-sheets#connecting-a-google-sheet-with-long-data)

## Step 3: Run an FX query in Runway

1. Once your FX Google Sheet integration has finished syncing, open the query editor in Runway.
2. Paste in the following SQL query to retrieve the exchange rate data.

   ```sql

       SELECT

   ```
3. Click **Run Query** to preview and validate the results.
4. Once successful, click **Configure New Database** to create a database from this query.
5. In the setup flow:
   - Rename the database (e.g., **FX Rates**).
   - Set the data source to the FX query you just created.
   - Under **Drivers**, choose between:
     - `AVG_AMOUNT` for **average monthly rates**
     - `EOM_AMOUNT` for **end-of-month rates**
   - Under **Segment by**, select both:
     - `FROM_CURRENCY` — the base currency (note: this will always be **USD** from the XE feed)
     - `TO_CURRENCY` — the currency you are converting **into**
6. Click **Confirm** to finish setting up the database.

## Step 4: Apply FX translation to your entity’s financial data

Now that you’ve imported exchange rates, you can use them to convert foreign-currency financial data into a unified currency (e.g., USD).

1. Navigate to the database for a subsidiary operating in a foreign currency (e.g., GBP).
2. Click **\+ Create New Property** and select **Number Driver**.
3. Give the new driver a clear name (e.g., **Amount in USD**) to distinguish it from the original amount driver.
4. Click the new column’s header and select **Add default formula**.
5. In the **Default Forecast**, enter your conversion formula:
   - **Amount [_This Segment_]** — the original amount coming from the integration.
   - **EOM_AMOUNT [GBP][USD]** — the end-of-month exchange rate from the FX table.
   - **AVG_AMOUNT [GBP][USD]** — the average exchange rate for the month.
   - Use **division** when converting from a foreign currency to USD, i.e., Amount [_This Segment_] / EOM_AMOUNT [GBP][USD]
   - Use **multiplication** when converting from USD to another currency, i.e., Amount [_This Segment_] \* EOM_AMOUNT [GBP][USD]
