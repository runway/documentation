This guide walks through adding a prorated salary field to your HRIS-sourced Employee database.

As a reminder, HRIS databases work differently than other Runway databases. For more information, please refer to our [HRIS databases article](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/databases/hris-databases#hris-databases).

## Step 1: Create `Prorated Monthly Salary` field

In your **Employee database**, add a **Number field**.

Name the field **Prorated Monthly Salary**.

## Step 2: Handle mid-month starts

1. Add a formula to **Prorated Salary**. Begin with an `if()` statement that checks if the start date falls within the current month.

2. If true, use the `dateDiff()` function to calculate the difference in days between the start date and the end of that month. You'll also want to add 1 day onto this, to ensure you're including the starting day too.

3. Use `daysInMonth()` to divide by the total days in the month and calculate the prorated percentage.

4. Multiply this prorated fraction by the employee's monthly salary (annual salary divided by 12).

## Step 3: Account for mid-month terminations

Extend your `IF()` formula to account for employees who terminate mid-month by adding a second condition.

1. Add a second `IF()` statement by copying the formula so far, and pasting it at the end. 
2. Then, update `This Employee.Start Date` to `This Employee.Termination Date` by clicking on each reference of `This Employee.Start Date` -\> hitting _Column_ -\> and then referencing `This Employee.Termination Date` instead.
3. Next, you'll want to update the dateDiff() function so that the first argument is the _start_ of the termination month, and the second argument is just the Termination Date itself.

## Step 4: Calculate full-month salaries

Finally, handle the default case where the employee worked the full month. Set the final case to the (annual) pay rate / 12 for full-month employees.

Hit **Enter** to save your formula and review your data. This column formula automatically applies to all employees in your database.
