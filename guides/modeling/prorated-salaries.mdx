This guide walks through adding a prorated salary field to your HRIS-sourced Employee database.

As a reminder, HRIS databases work differently than other Runway databases. For more information, please refer to our [HRIS databases article](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/databases/hris-databases#hris-databases).

## Step 1: Create `Prorated Salary` field

In your **Employee database**, add a **Number field**.

Name the field **Prorated Salary**.

## Step 2: Handle mid-month starts

1. Add a formula to **Prorated Salary**. Begin with an `IF()` statement that checks if the start date falls within the current month.

2. If true, use the `dateDiff()` function to calculate the difference in days between the start date and the end of that month.

3. Use `daysInMonth()` to divide by the total days in the month and calculate the prorated percentage.

4. Multiply this prorated fraction by the employee's monthly salary (annual salary divided by 12).

## Step 3: Account for mid-month terminations

Extend your `IF()` formula to account for employees who terminate mid-month by adding a second condition.

1. Add a second `IF()` statement that checks if the employee termination date is this month. Copy the formula from Step 2 above and update to reference `This Employee.Termination Date`.

2. Update the `dateDiff()` function to reference the start of the month, since the employee is leaving mid-month.

## Step 4: Calculate full-month salaries

Finally, handle the default case where the employee worked the full month. Set the final case to Annual Salary / 12 for full-month employees.

Hit **Enter** to save your formula and review your data. This column formula automatically applies to all employees in your database.
