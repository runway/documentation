Because quota attainment directly impacts top-line metrics like ARR, Burn, and Cash, it’s a core component of many forecasts, especially for bookings, ramp planning, and commissions.

Common modeling inputs include:

- Start dates for new hires
- Annual and monthly quotas
- Ramp period logic
- Historical attainment trends or override assumptions

## Step 1: Build sales team database

The first step is separating out your sales team from your other headcount planning. As discussed in our [HRIS databases article](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/databases/hris-databases), headcount databases from integrations will behave differently than our standard dimensional database.

You’ll want to bring your sales team out into a dimensional database, as leveraging dimensions for quota attainment is faster and more flexible.

1. Create a new database and set your column headers to the dimensions that will be applicable for quota attainment. In this example, that’s `Name`, `Title`, `Seniority`, `Market`, and `Start Date`.

2. Then, paste in that data from your HRIS-integration powered Employee database.

3. Layer in any projected hires by adding new items to the database.

  You can anonymize any sensitive compensation data by right-clicking the column header and selecting ‘Anonymize Data’. More details [here](https://docs.runway.com/guides/sharing/data-anonymization#how-to-anonymize-data).

## Step 2: Add annual quotas per employee

Add an **Annual Quota** driver column directly in your **Sales Team database**.

Here, we assign an annual quota based on seniority. This formula will apply to all rows in this database because it’s the default formula.

![Step2 1 Pn](/images/quota/step2-1.png)

Depending on the complexity of your model, you could layer in additional segmentations of quota assignment here. For example, some businesses assign quotas based on seniority _and_ market segmentation. Simply nest IF() statements to achieve your desired level of granularity.

Here, we’re saying if you’re a Senior AE focused on the Enterprise market, you have a \$1m annual quota. If you’re Senior but focused on other markets, you have a \$500k quota. Otherwise, you have a \$200k quota.

It is also possible to have individualized sales targets by overriding the default formula for particular employees.

![Step2 3 Pn](/images/quota/step2-3.png)

## Step 3: Add ramp assumptions

1. **Add **`months_since_start:`

   Use `dateDiff()` to calculate the difference between their start date and the month evaluated in the model. By wrapping it in an `IF()` statement, we can set a floor of 0, which will populate for projected future hires.

   ![Step3 1 Pn](/images/quota/step3-1.png)
2. **Calculate **`monthly_quota:`

   Start by taking Annual Quota divided by 12:

   ![Step3 2 Pn](/images/quota/step3-2.png)

   Then, build in a ramping assumption to take into account that a new hire will take time to reach full performance. For this example, we’ll assume there’s a 2-month cliff before AEs start closing deals and it takes 6 months to get fully ramped up:

   ![Step3 3 Pn](/images/quota/step3-3.png)

  Many users also layer in seasonality assumptions at this point. For more details on seasonality, refer to [this article](https://docs.runway.com/guides/modeling/seasonal-forecasting).

## Step 4: Bookings capacity & attainment model

Create a new database with your Sales Team database as the source. Bring in the `monthly_quota` data as a driver. You’ll want to segment this data by the granularity you forecast your revenue. In this example, we want to use `Market` from our Sales Team but we don’t forecast revenue based on `Seniority` like we did in the Sales Team database so we’ll leave that out.

![Step4 1 Pn](/images/quota/step4-1.png)

At this stage, what you have is a 100% attainment booking capacity, with ramp and seasonality baked in for each segment. However, to reflect real-world performance, most bookings capacity models apply an attainment assumption to avoid over-inflating forecasted ARR.

Add this assumption in as a column:

![Step4 2 Pn](/images/quota/step4-2.png)

The final step is calculating your fully ramped, adjusted Bookings Capacity, which reflects realistic attainment for each segment.
