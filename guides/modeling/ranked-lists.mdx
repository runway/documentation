Ranked lists allow you to identify and focus on your most important customers, vendors, or contracts by automatically calculating rankings based on key metrics like ARR, contract value, or spending. This workflow is essential for understanding your top performers and can drive strategic decision-making across sales, procurement, and customer success.

## Overview

This workflow involves adding dynamic ranking calculations to your existing databases, then using filters to display only your top performers. Rankings update automatically as your underlying data changes, ensuring you're always seeing current top performers.

## Step 1: Prepare your database

You'll need an existing database with the metric you want to rank by. Common examples include:

- **Customer database** with ARR or revenue metrics
- **Vendor database** with annual spending amounts
- **Contract database** with contract values
- **Employee database** with salary or quota metrics

## Step 2: Add a rank calculation column

Create a dynamic ranking system that automatically updates as your data changes.

**Add the rank driver:**

- Navigate to your database
- Add a number driver column by clicking **\+** and selecting **number driver**
- Name this driver **Rank** (or **ARR Rank**, **Contract Value Rank**, etc.)
- Click on the driver column name and select **Add Default Formula**

**Configure the ranking formula:**

- Type `COUNT()` to use the count function
- Begin typing your database name to surface the database reference
- Choose the **database column reference** option (not the direct driver reference)
- Click the database pill to open formula editor options
- Click **\+ Add Rule** to add the ranking filter

**Set up the ranking logic:**

- Set **[Metric Column]** `is greater than` **[Metric Column] This Segment**
  - For example: **ARR** `is greater than` **ARR This Segment**
  - This counts how many rows have a higher value than the current row
- Add **\+ 1** to the end of the formula to convert to standard ranking format. This makes your top rank #1, rather than #0.

**Complete formula example:**

`COUNT([Database Name].[Metric Column]) + 1`

Where the COUNT function has the "greater than This Segment" filter applied.

## Step 3: Validate your rankings

Verify that your ranking system is working correctly.

**Check the results:**

- Your highest value record should show **Rank = 1**
- Your second highest should show **Rank = 2**
- Rankings should be consecutive (1, 2, 3, 4...) unless there are ties

**Sort your database view:**

- Click the column header of your ranking metric (ARR, Contract Value, etc.)
- Select **Sort Descending** to show highest values first
- Verify that Rank 1 corresponds to your highest value

## Step 4: Using Rank throughout your workspace

### Filter for top performers in database view or database block

Apply filters directly in your database to focus on top performers.

**Filter the database view:**

- In your database, click **\+ Add Filter**
- Select your **Rank** driver
- Set the condition to `is less than or equal to` and enter your desired number
  - For top 10 customers: **Rank** `is less than or equal to` **10**
  - For top 5 vendors: **Rank** `is less than or equal to` **5**

**Sort for better visibility:**

- Click the column header of your ranking metric (ARR, Contract Value, etc.)
- Select **Sort Descending** to show highest values first
- This displays your top performers in order from highest to lowest

### Reference ranked data in models and formulae

Use your top performers data to drive calculations in financial models.

**Sum top performer metrics:**

- In a model, create a driver like **Top 10 Customer ARR**
- Click into the forecast formula and type `sum()`
- Reference your database with appropriate filters:
  - Database reference: **Customer Database.ARR**
  - Add filter: **Customer Database.Rank** `is less than or equal to` **10**

**Track concentration metrics:**

- Create percentage calculations showing what portion of revenue comes from top customers
- Example: **Top 5 Customer %** = `[Top 5 Customer ARR] รท [Total ARR]`
