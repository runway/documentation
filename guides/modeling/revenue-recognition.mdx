title: "Revenue Recognition"
description: "Revenue recognition refers to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that determine when and how revenue gets recognized in financial statements.  The accounting principles require that businesses recognize revenue when it’s earned (accrual accounting) rather than when payment is received (cash accounting).  Correctly applying the rules for revenue recognition is crucial for accurately interpreting and forecasting revenue.your new file. This article explains how to build a revenue recognition model in Runway for recurring contracts. Runway is designed to support flexible, customizable modeling — if you don’t see your exact business or contract type in our docs, our team can help. "

## Step 1: Prepare your integrations and databases

First, connect the data sources you plan to use model revenue recognition. Runway has [CRM](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/revenue/hubspot), [data warehouse](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/data-storage/data-warehouses#data-warehouses), and [google sheet ](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/data-storage/google-sheets)integrations available.

You can also manually copy data into a Runway database. You will need to follow [database configuration directions](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/databases/databases-basics#configuring-a-database).

The Runway team can help you write a query that will bring in the fields that you will need for revenue recognition modeling from your integration source.

Typically, for a revenue recognition model the contract or deal databases are segmented by a unique ID and Customer Name, depending on the fields your business uses to track contracts.

The following items brought into Runway as number and date drivers are standard for a revenue recognition model:

- Contract Amount
- Contract Term length
- Contract Start Date
- Contract End Date

An example of a simple contract database looks like the following:

- Contract ID and Customer Name dimensions are set as Segments
- Contract Start Date, Contract Value and Contract Term (Months) are Drivers
- Payment Cadence is an Other column, meaning it is metadata tied to each Contract ID and Customer Name segment

## **Step 2: Set up Contract Start Date, Contract End Date and Contract Term Length**

To recognize revenue over the length of a contract, you will need Start Date, Contract Term and Contract End Date drivers

You can calculate Contract End Date using Start Date and Contract Term (Months):

1. Add a date driver column by clicking the \+ at the right hand side of the database and selecting date driver

   ![Addingdatedriver Pn](/CleanShot2025-05-14at12.53.55@2x.png)
2. Name the date driver: Contract End Date
3. Click on the driver column name and select Add Default Formula. Default formulas allow you to set a formula for every segment of the driver.
4. Use `DateAdd()` to calculate the Contract End Date based on Contract Start Date and Contract Term Length.

   The formula will be defined as: = DateAdd( Contract Start Date _This Segment_ This Month, Contract Term (Months) _This Segment_ This Month, ‘m’)

   <Note>
     Note that the units must be wrapped in single-quotes, e.g. months as 'm'

Alternatively, you can calculate Contract Term (Months) from Contract Start Date and Contract End Date

1. Add a number driver column by clicking the \+ at the right hand side of the database and selecting number driver

   ![Addingnumberdriver Pn](/CleanShot2025-05-14at13.41.32@2x.png)
2. Edit the name for the number driver column
3. Clicking on the driver column name, select Add Default Formula to set a formula for every Segment of data (in this example, a formula for Contract Term Length will be propagated to each intersection of Contract ID and Customer Name)
4. Use DateDiff() function to calculate a Contract Term Length based on contract start date and Contract End Date. The formula will be defined as:

   = DateDiff( Contract Start Date _This Segment_ This Month, Contract End Date _This Segment_ This Month, ‘m’)

## Step 3: Build logic to recognize revenue over length of contract

Here’s how to create a formula that will spread your revenue over the period that services get delivered.

1. Add a number driver column to the database by clicking the \+ to the right of the last database column

![Addingnumberdriver Pn](/CleanShot2025-05-14at13.41.32@2x.png)

2. Name this driver Monthly Recognized Revenue
3. Click into the driver name and select Edit default formula to open the default formula editor for the driver column
4. Begin typing Contract Value to surface the Contract Value driver
   - You will see two options to reference the Contract Value driver
     - A database column reference option with the naming convention Database Name.Driver Column. This option gives you the affordance to apply date filters and filters for dimensions you have not set as database Segments. You want to choose this option since we need date filters for revenue recognition calculations
     - Direct Driver reference option, listed as Contract Value _This Segment._ This option offers cleaner name format and the ability to filter based on database Segments


5. Click the driver pill to open the formula editor options
6. Click \+ Add Rule to add filters to the formula. These will time-bound how contract value hits your model.
   1. Set Contract Start Date.Month is on or before This month
   2. Set Contract End Date.Month is after This month
   3. `Segment is This Segment` will ensure this logic gets applied across all segments of the driver, which in this example, means across all slices of Contract ID x Customer Name. You can review how to create dynamic formulas using _This Segment_ [here](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/databases/formulas-in-databases#example%3A-dynamic-default-formula-using-this-segment)
