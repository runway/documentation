title: "Adding users"
description: "You can add users to your Runway organization in two ways: via the Settings menu or from the Share menu on a specific page, model, or database.Description of your new file."
---

We recommend:

- Using **Settings** to add Admins, Managers, or Members.
- Using the **Share** menu to invite Guests directly to the content they need.

<Warning>
  Runway does **not** send email invites when you add users. After adding someone, share your org’s URL—or a direct link to a specific page—to help them get started. When they visit the link, they’ll be prompted to log in and then routed to the content they’ve been granted access to.
</Warning>

## Adding users via settings

Use this method when adding Admins, Managers, Members:

1. Click your avatar in the top-right corner and select **Settings.**

2. Go to the **Users** tab.

   ![Settings Users Pn](/images/adding-users/settings-users.png)
3. Enter one or more email addresses (comma- or space-separated).
4. Assign a role: Admin, Manager, Member, or Guest.

5. Click **Add.**

<Warning>
  Admins and Managers automatically get access to all pages, models, and databases. **Members and Guests don’t have content access by default**—you’ll need to explicitly share specific items with them via the Share menu (see below).
</Warning>

## Adding users via share menu

This method is best for inviting **Guests** or external users who need limited access to specific resources.

Users added for the first time through the Share menu are automatically assigned the **Guest** role. You can always update their role later in **Settings**.

### Step 1: Add user emails

1. Open the page, model, or database you want to share.
2. Click **Share** in the top-right corner.
3. Enter one or more email addresses.
   - If the user is already in your organization, their name will appear in the dropdown.
   - If not, you’ll be prompted to add them.
   - You can also paste multiple emails, separated by commas or spaces.

### Step 2: Set the appropriate access level

Once added, you can adjust each user's [access level](https://docs.runway.com/guides/sharing/access-levels) to the shared page, model, or database:

- **Guests:**
  - **Can view** or **No access.**
- **Members & Managers:**
  - **Can view**, **Can edit**, **Full access**, or **No access.**
- **Admins:**
  - Automatically granted **Full access** across all pages, models, and databases.

### Step 3: Manage scenario access for Guests

Guests can only see scenarios that have been explicitly shared with them.

To manage this:

1. Navigate to the **Guest Settings** tab on the shared page, model, or database.
2. Select which scenarios Guests can view—by default, only the **Main** scenario is enabled.

<Info>
  Scenario access for Guests is set per page and applies to **all** Guests on that page.
</Info>

## Using a Guest invite link

For easier bulk access, you can enable a **Guest invite link**. Anyone with this link will be able to view the shared resource.

If someone uses the link and hasn't been added to Runway before, they’ll automatically be added to your org as a **Guest** and appear in your user list.

The link grants access to the specific page, model, or database it was generated from. You can disable it at any time from the Share menu.

## Managing users

Admins can manage all users—and view their roles and access levels across your org—by going to **Settings \> Users**.

For each user, you’ll see:

- Their **current role** — click to update it.
- The number of pages, models, and databases they have access to — click to view the full list and update access levels as needed.

You can tell whether someone has accessed Runway by checking their avatar. Users who haven’t logged in yet won’t have a profile photo.
