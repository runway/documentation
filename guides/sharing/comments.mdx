## What you can comment on

You can leave comments on most core surfaces in Runway via the right click menu, or by clicking on the six-dot menu for a block. You can also comment on pages via the ellipsis menu in the side navigation.

Existing comments are indicated by a notch in the top-right of the corresponding cell (for comments on specific cells) or a dot to the left of the block (for comments on blocks).

When writing a comment, you can @-mention a user and it will send them an in-app notification.

You can resolve a comment thread by clicking the checkbox on a thread. This will hide the resolved comment thread from view.

## Comments notifications

The top navigation bar has a tray to surface the comment threads you're involved in.

The first tab, "My threads", highlights threads you're following (tagged or participating in). The second tab, "Other threads in this scenario", shows all comments on the scenario you're currently viewing, including ones you are not yet following.

Click a comment to navigate to comment's target content. This may navigate you to a different scenario.

## Commenting and permissions

Viewing and participating in comment threads is dictated by the permissions associated with where the comment is made â€” both at the driver or page level, and the scenario it's made on.

You can make comments on Runway content that you have Edit access to. 

Note that giving your teammates "Edit" access is not too risky to Main Scenario, given they change any of the content, Runway will push them to a draft scenario automatically. Only Admins have permissions to merge changes into Main proper.

## Comments and Scenarios

**Reading comments:**

As you navigate the app, you will see comments made on your current scenario. In addition, if you're on a scenario that automatically pulls updates from Main, you'll see comments from Main. 

**Writing comments:**

Comments are made to the scenario that is currently active.

Merging a scenario does not resolve comments. You can see comments that are staged for merging in the "Compare and merge" screen.

- If you are on the Main Scenario (not a draft) comments will be made directly onto Main Scenario, immediately visible to others.
- If you're working on a non-Main Scenario, comments are made directly to that scenario, visible to all users with access to that scenario
- If you're working on a draft, comments will be made onto the draft. 
  - For others to see your comments on a draft, you'll have to do one of the following
    - @-mention someone in a comment. They'll be notified in the app and be able to navigate to your draft.
    - Share a link to your draft.
    - Or [merge](link) your draft into the Main Scenario
