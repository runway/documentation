title: "User roles"
description: "Collaboration is central to how teams use Runway. Some customers give their entire company access to portions of their model, while others use Runway for external collaboration with investors and board members. To support these varied use cases, Runway offers four user roles with different levels of access."
---

Each role has specific permissions, depending on what a user needs to do:

- **Admin** — Full access to all data and settings. Typically assigned to finance team members who own the model.
- **Manager** — Can view and edit data. Default access to all data but with restrictions around anonymized information, org-level settings, and some other controls.
- **Member** — Internal role with no access by default. Access must be granted per page.
- **Guest** — View-only access to specific shared content. Ideal for external collaborators like board members or investors.

In the sections below, we break down what each role _can_ and _cannot_ do in Runway.
