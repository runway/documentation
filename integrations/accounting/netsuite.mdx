## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

1. A **NetSuite administrative account**
2. The [**SuiteAnalytics Connect Service**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/book_N748613.html) enabled, with access to either the [**NetSuite.com**](http://NetSuite.com) or [**NetSuite2.com**](http://NetSuite2.com) data source

3. Click **\+ Add to Runway** on the template card.

     - **BS Data** (Balance Sheet)

## NetSuite FAQs

<Accordion title="Can you bring in custom columns, fields or lists from NetSuite?">
  Yes, absolutely. If you’re comfortable writing SQL, refer to our [SQL in Runway guide](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/writing-sql) for instructions. If you’d prefer help from our team, feel free to reach out to CX. When you do, it’s helpful to come prepared with:

  - The name of the field(s) you'd like to pull.
  - Example data values from those fields.
  - What the field is associated with (e.g. Customer, Vendor, Transaction, or Transaction Line).
  - Bonus: A screenshot from NetSuite’s **Record Explorer** showing how the field is defined.

<Accordion title="Can you bring in non-finance related data from NetSuite?">
  Yes. You’re not limited to just financial data—Runway can pull in operational, sales, or other business-critical data from NetSuite as well. To explore what’s available, check out:

  - Our [SQL in Runway guide](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/writing-sql)
  - [This ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/netsuite-suiteanalytics#schemainformation) from our integration partner, Fivetran, which outlines the full set of accessible tables and fields
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is SuiteAnalytics Connect required?">
  Yes. SuiteAnalytics Connect is essential for enabling a reliable integration with NetSuite. Without it, Runway cannot access your NetSuite data.

  Most customers already have this add-on enabled prior to starting with Runway. If you’re unsure whether it’s included in your plan, or need to enable it, reach out to NetSuite for details on access and pricing.
