Runway offers two ways to integrate with **Xero**:

- **SQL-powered integration via Fivetran (Recommended)** – For advanced data customization.

## Setting up Xero via Fivetran

### **Connecting the Integration**

2. In the left sidebar, hover over **Integrations** and click the **+** button to open the **Integrations Directory**.
3. Search for **Xero** and click **\+ Set up** under the **Fivetran** option.
4. For the **Schema Name**:
   - If connecting **a single Xero instance**, leave it as `Xero`.
   - If connecting **multiple Xero instances**, update the **Schema Name** with a unique identifier (e.g., `Xero_us`, `Xero_ltd`).
5. Click **Authorize** to be redirected to **Fivetran** to complete the connection.
6. Follow Fivetran’s **setup guide** to finish configuring the integration.

   - Create the following databases in Runway:
     - **IS Data** (Income Statement)
     - **BS Data** (Balance Sheet)
