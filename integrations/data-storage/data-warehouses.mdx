description: "Runway integrates with a variety of data warehouse providers, allowing you to pull data that has already been processed, transformed, or sourced from systems that Runway does not integrate with directly."

## **Supported data warehouses**

We strongly support the following providers:

- **Snowflake** → [Setup guide](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/snowflake.html#how-to-connect-to-snowflake-on-workato)
- **Google BigQuery** → [Setup guide](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/bigquery.html#how-to-connect-to-bigquery-on-workato)
- **Amazon Redshift** → [Setup guide](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/redshift.html#how-to-connect-to-redshift-on-workato)

Setup guides are linked directly in **Runway**, but they are also available here for reference.

## **Which integration to choose**

Whenever possible, install the data warehouse which does not have **(Fivetran)** in the name. You want to choose the one under the **Data Warehouse **section**.**

The only exceptions to this rule are:

1. You wish to join your data warehouse data to Fivetran data directly in SQL.
2. You have multiple of the same data warehouses you need to connect (2\+ Snowflake or 2\+ Big Query data warehouses)

## **How Runway connects to your data warehouse**

Runway has an in-app **SQL editor** that allows us to query your data warehouse directly. To set up the connection:

1. **Create a user** for Runway in your data warehouse.
2. **Add our provider’s IP addresses** to your allowlist (found [here](https://docs.workato.com/security/ip-allowlists.html)).

  Runway leverages the **US** data center.

## Data warehouses FAQs

<Accordion title="How do I write SQL in Runway?" icon="sparkles">
  See our [help doc](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/writing-sql).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What other databases can Runway pull from?" icon="sparkles">
  We also support **SQL databases** (via **Fivetran**) for:

  - **PostgreSQL**
  - **MySQL**
  - **SQL Server** (including **Azure, Google, and AWS-hosted** instances)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a row limit on data queries?" icon="sparkles">
  Yes, each query must return fewer than **50,000 rows**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I work around the row limit?" icon="sparkles">
  If your dataset exceeds **50,000 rows**, consider the following solutions:

  - **Aggregate data in SQL** → Use `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, or similar functions to reduce the row count.
  - **Limit the data scope** → Restrict queries by **time range** or other relevant filters.
  - **Split large datasets** → Break data into multiple **queries or databases** (e.g., by product line or geography).
