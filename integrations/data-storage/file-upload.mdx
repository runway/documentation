description: "Runway's File Upload integration allows you to quickly import CSV files directly into Runway for use in modeling."
---

You may choose to use File Upload if:

- You need to **import data quickly** without setting up a full integration.
- You have **CSV files** from systems that don't have direct integrations.
- You want to **test data** in Runway before committing to a full integration setup.
- You have **one-time data imports** that don't require ongoing syncing.

## File requirements

Before uploading your CSV file, ensure it meets these requirements:

- **File format**: Only `.csv` files are supported.
- **File size**: Maximum file size is **50MB**.
- **Data structure**: The first row should contain column headers.
- **Data quality**: Ensure at least one data row exists below the headers.
- **Date format**: Use **MM/DD/YYYY** format for date columns (e.g., `01/15/2024`).

<Tip>
  For best results, clean your CSV file before uploading—remove extra blank rows, ensure consistent column headers, and format dates as **MM/DD/YYYY** (e.g., `01/15/2024`).
</Tip>

## Connecting the File Upload integration

1. Open Runway and navigate to **Integrations**.
2. Find and install the **File Upload** integration listed under the **Data storage** section.
3. A new query called **New File Upload** will be automatically created.
4. You can rename this query by clicking the **three-dots button** next to the query name in the sidebar and selecting **Rename query**.

## Uploading a CSV file

Once you've connected the File Upload integration:

1. Click on your File Upload query in the sidebar.
2. In the query editor, you'll see a file upload interface.
3. Click **Choose File** and select your CSV file (must be `.csv` format and under 50MB).
4. The file will upload automatically. You'll see a confirmation message when the upload is complete.
5. Click **Run query** to import the data into Runway.

<Warning>
  File uploads must be run manually. Unlike other integrations, File Upload queries cannot be scheduled to sync automatically.
</Warning>

## Refreshing data

To update the data in your File Upload query:

1. Upload a new CSV file using the same steps above.
2. Click **Run query** to refresh the data.
3. The new data will replace the previous data in your linked database.

<Info>
  Each time you upload a new file and run the query, it completely replaces the previous data. Make sure your new file contains all the data you need.
</Info>

## Using uploaded data in databases

After running your File Upload query:

1. [Configure a new database](https://docs.runway.com/concepts/databases/databases-basics#configuring-a-database) linked to your File Upload query.
2. The database will display the data from your CSV file.
3. You can now use this data in your models, pages, and formulas just like any other integration.

## File upload FAQs

<Accordion title="Can I schedule File Upload queries to sync automatically?" icon="sparkles">
  No. File Upload queries must be run manually. If you need automatic syncing, consider using [Google Sheets](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/data-storage/google-sheets) or a [data warehouse](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/data-storage/data-warehouses) integration instead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my CSV file is larger than 50MB?" icon="sparkles">
  Files larger than 50MB cannot be uploaded. You'll need to either:
  
  - **Split your file** into smaller CSV files and create multiple File Upload queries.
  - **Aggregate your data** before exporting to reduce the file size.
  - Use a [data warehouse](https://docs.runway.com/integrations/data-storage/data-warehouses) integration for larger datasets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I upload multiple CSV files to the same query?" icon="sparkles">
  No. Each File Upload query can only contain data from one CSV file at a time. When you upload a new file and run the query, it replaces the previous data. If you need to import multiple CSV files, create separate File Upload queries for each file.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What CSV formats are supported?" icon="sparkles">
  Runway supports standard CSV files with:
  
  - **Comma-separated values** (`,` as delimiter)
  - **Column headers** in the first row
  - **At least one data row** below the headers
  - **Date columns** formatted as **MM/DD/YYYY** (e.g., `01/15/2024`)
  
  The CSV parser is flexible and handles quoted fields and leading/trailing spaces automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why isn't my uploaded file showing data?" icon="sparkles">
  If you don't see data after uploading and running the query, check:
  
  - Your CSV file has **column headers** in the first row.
  - There is **at least one data row** below the headers.
  - The file is **properly formatted** as a CSV (not Excel or other formats).
  - You clicked **Run query** after uploading the file.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I edit the CSV data directly in Runway?" icon="sparkles">
  No. File Upload queries are read-only. To modify the data, you need to:
  
  1. Edit your CSV file outside of Runway.
  2. Upload the updated CSV file.
  3. Click **Run query** to refresh the data.
