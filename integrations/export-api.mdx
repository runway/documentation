   1. Grab the URL of the Database or Model you want to pull data from
   2. **Replace "app.runway.com/org-url" with "api.runway.com/api"**
      - `https://app.runway.com/skynet/submodel/afd94c7e-1e7f-4e55-b99a-472aa5a43cd9`
      - becomes

## Limitations

- If you have a database with multiple drivers, Runway will only show the time series data that is currently expanded on that page.
- If you want multiple drivers from a database, shape a new database off that existing database and pull from separate databases.
- The time period pulled is limited to the filters applied on the database and model.
- Formulas cannot be exported at this time.
- The exported data is in csv format only
