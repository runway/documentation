description: "Runway offers a limited API to allow you to export model and database views programmatically."
---

## Supported objects

You are able to export models & databases. **Page exports are currently unavailable.**

- **Main Scenario Model URL example**: `https://app.runway.com/skynet/submodel/afd94c7e-1e7f-4e55-b99a-472aa5a43cd9`
- **Scenario Model URL example**: `https://app.runway.com/skynet/proposal/445f8fea-df2a-49cb-9cce-f805be588137/submodel/afd94c7e-1e7f-4e55-b99a-472aa5a43cd9`
- **Main Scenario Database example**: `https://app.runway.com/skynet/page/5fb5f2a6-7a13-4085-a89c-86e2da66a17c`
- **Scenario Database URL example**: `https://app.runway.com/skynet/proposal/445f8fea-df2a-49cb-9cce-f805be588137/page/5fb5f2a6-7a13-4085-a89c-86e2da66a17c`

## Limitations

- **This API is very limited and intended to make data available quickly.**
- If you have a database with multiple Drivers, Runway will only show the time series data that is currently expanded on that page.
  - If you want multiple drivers from a Database, shape a new database off that existing database and pull from separate databases
- The time period pulled is limited to the filters applied on the database & model
- Formulas are not exported
- **The exported data is in csv format only**
