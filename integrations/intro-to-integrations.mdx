## Overview

Integration data is the foundation of building in Runway. In this article, we’ll walk through how data flows from your connected sources into Runway—at the right level of granularity—so you can build with accuracy and confidence

## How runway connects to your data

Runway offers **two ways** to connect to external data sources. Some integrations support **both** methods, while others are available through only one.

### Option 1: Quick-start integrations

- These integrations provide an **easy, no-code connection**.

- Ideal for getting started quickly with structured data.

- **Best for:** standardized datasets that don’t require customization (i.e. HRIS)

### Option 2: Flexible, SQL-powered\* integrations via Fivetran

- Allows for **deeper, more customizable data pulls** using SQL queries.

- Requires additional setup but provides more **granularity and control** over imported data.

- **Best for:** Integrations that need custom data fields or more detailed reporting (i.e. Accounting, CRM, Data Warehouse).
